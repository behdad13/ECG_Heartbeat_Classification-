Sickkids_Interview
==============================

An A-Z project for classification of heartbeats using a Deep Learning model (CNN)


All explanations for EDA, feature engineering, data modelling, model evaluation, model deployements are described clearly with code in a jupyter notebook (**Notebooks Directory**)

explanation of .py files:
1. make_dataset.py: it converts data from raw format and transfers to the interim folder.
2. build_features.py: it converts data from intermediate to processed and ready-to-use format.
3. train_model.py: It trains and validate the model. It also includes hyperparameter tuning.
4. predict_model.py: It predicts the result and tests the model with test and hold-out set.
5. visualize.py: It visualizes graphs, charts, and confusion matrix.

I added a folder, called deployement. it includes flask application of the project. It gets .csv file, containing a record of ECG signals and gives you the ECG class type
